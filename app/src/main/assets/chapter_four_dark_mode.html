          <p class="textbookp">
            Sputnik 22 was an attempted Mars flyby mission, presumably similar to the Mars 1 mission launched 8 days later. The intended Mars probe had a mass of 893.5 kg. The spacecraft and attached upper stage, with a total mass of 6500 kg, were launched by an SL-6 into a 180 x 485 km Earth parking orbit with an inclination of 64.9 degrees and either broke up as they were going into Earth orbit or had the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into Mars trajectory. In either case, the spacecraft broke into many pieces, some of which remained in Earth orbit for a few days. (This occurred during the Cuban missile crisis. The debris was detected by the U.S. Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radar in Alaska and was momentarily feared to be the start of a Soviet nuclear ICBM attack.)
This spacecraft was originally designated Sputnik 29 in the U.S. Naval Space Command Satellite Situation Summary.

          <p class="textbookp">
            The designations Sputnik 29, and later Sputnik 22, were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit. A United States Ballistic Missile Early Warning System station in Alaska detected the debris from the launch and initially identified it as incoming nuclear warheads since the launch had occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

            <p class="textbookp">
            The lower stages of the rocket performed nominally, placing the payload and the Blok L upper stage into low Earth orbit. When the Blok L ignited following a coast phase, lubricant leaked out of the turbopump, which consequently seized up and disintegrated. This caused the main engine to explode, destroying the upper stage and spacecraft.

              Mariner 8 was launched on an Atlas-Centaur SLV-3C booster (AC-24). The main Centaur engine was ignited 265 seconds after launch, but the upper stage began to oscillate in pitch and tumbled out of control. The Centaur stage shut down 365 seconds after launch due to starvation caused by the tumbling. The Centaur and spacecraft payload separated and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere approximately 1500 km downrange and fell into the Atlantic Ocean about 560 km north of Puerto Rico.

              A guidance system failure was quickly suspected as the culprit, but JPL navigation chief Bill O'Neil dismissed the idea that the entire guidance system had failed. He argued that an autopilot malfunction had occurred since the event had occurred at the exact moment when the system was supposed to activate. The investigation proceeded quickly and the problem was soon discovered to be the result of a malfunction in the pitch rate gyro amplifier. A diode intended to protect the system from transient voltages was thought to have been damaged during repairs/installation of the pitch amplifier's printed circuit board, something that would not have been detected through bench tests.

              As of 2020, Mariner 8 is the most recent US planetary probe to be lost in a launch vehicle malfunction.

                Zond 2 was an automatic interplanetary station launched from a Tyazheliy Sputnik (1964-078A) in Earth parking orbit towards Mars to test space-borne systems and to carry out scientific investigations. The probe carried a descent craft and the same instruments like the Mars 1 flyby spacecraft: a magnetometer probe, television photographic equipment, a Spectro reflectometer, radiation sensors (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), charged particle traps, a spectrograph to study ozone absorption bands, and a micrometeoroid instrument.

              <p class="textbookp">
                The Zond 2 station consisted of two hermetically sealed modules, the orbital module, and the special module. Mounted on the orbital module was a large parabolic dish antenna for transmissions, a broad beam receiving antenna, solar panels, hemispherical radiators for thermal control, trajectory correction engines, compressed nitrogen bottles, gas-reaction orientation system engines, optical sensors for the orientation system, and scientific sensors. Housed within the orbital module were the gyroscopes and command, control, orientation, and correction systems, batteries, timers, radio telemetry system, thermal regulation internal heat exchangers, and some scientific equipment. The special module held the radio system, batteries, and the scientific instrument payload. The spacecraft had six experimental low-thrust electrojet plasma ion engines that served as actuators of the attitude control system and could be used instead of the gas engines to maintain orientation. Power was provided by the two solar panels.              </p>

                <p class="textbookp">
                  One of the two solar panels failed due to a broken tug cord, so only half the anticipated power was available to the spacecraft. Controllers were able to finally get the second solar panel to open on 15 December 1964 by firing the plasma engines to shake it free, but this was too late for the crucial first mid-course maneuver. After a putative (but unconfirmed) mid-course maneuver on 17 February 1965, communications with the spacecraft were lost in early May 1965. The spacecraft flew by Mars on 6 August 1965 at a distance of 1500 km and a relative speed of 5.62 km/s. However, some accounts hold that the communications were lost a month or so after launch and no further contact was made with the spacecraft.

                    Zond 3 was a 1965 space probe which performed a flyby of the Moon's far side, taking several quality photographs for its time. It was a member of the Soviet Zond program while also being part of the Mars 3MV project. It was unrelated to Zond spacecraft designed for manned circumlunar missions (Soyuz 7K-L1). It is believed that Zond 3 was initially designed as a companion spacecraft to Zond 2 to be launched to Mars during the 1964 launch window. The opportunity to launch was missed, and the spacecraft was launched on a Mars-crossing trajectory as a spacecraft test, even though Mars was no longer attainable.

                      The mission was ended after radio contact ceased on March 3, 1966, when it was at a distance of 153.5 million km (95.4 million mi). It operated for 228 days, roughly equivalent to the time needed to survive a journey to Mars and exceeding that needed for Venus.
